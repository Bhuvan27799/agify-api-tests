**Agify API Test Automation â€“ Kaluza **

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Bhuvan Ahuja, and this is my BDD test suite for the Agify API.

The API predicts the likely age for a given name. This test suite demonstrates my API testing skills using Cucumber, TypeScript, and Axios, and covers scenarios like:

Valid GET requests

Invalid parameters

Unsupported HTTP methods (POST)

Correct status codes and response structure

âš¡ The focus here is on functionality, reliability, and automated verification of the API, not the accuracy of predicted ages.

**How to Run**

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/Bhuvan27799/agify-api-tests.git
cd agify-tests
npm install


**Run the tests:**

npm test


You should see an output similar to:

5 scenarios (5 passed)
16 steps (16 passed)

Notes

All steps handle errors gracefully (e.g., 4xx/5xx responses).

The test suite uses ES Modules, so make sure your environment supports it.

The feature file contains scenarios for valid names, invalid parameters, and unsupported HTTP methods.
